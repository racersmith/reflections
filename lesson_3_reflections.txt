When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with a team.  When working at multiple locations.  When you want to have an offsite backup.
  
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For the same reasons that you want to select when you commit changes.  If you are using GitHub as a public repository then you may have commits locally that are not ready for primetime.  Pushing changes to remotes would allow you to push more stable versions only.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Clone is used to copy a repository to local location.
	Fork is used to copy a reposiitory within GitHub
	Branch is used to make changes without disrupting another running line of changes on another branch, typically master.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	Allows for comparison between your local changes and the last state as well as changes between the last known local and a fetched version of the remote.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Now that I'm getting familiar with git I don't know what I would do.  Probably just have a common folder that everyone just makes changes to.  Pull down local copies and do your work then replace the files in the common folder when you are really happy with your work.  Maybe faster in the short term but much harder overall when you start running into conflicting changes.
