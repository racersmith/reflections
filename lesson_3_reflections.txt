When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with a team.  When working at multiple locations.  When you want to have an offsite backup.
  
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	For the same reasons that you want to select when you commit changes.  If you are using GitHub as a public repository then you may have commits locally that are not ready for primetime.  Pushing changes to remotes would allow you to push more stable versions only.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Clone is used to copy a repository to local location.
	Fork is used to copy a reposiitory within GitHub
	Branch is used to make changes without disrupting another running line of changes on another branch, typically master.
